          NatureDex identifies plants by analyzing photos that you take or upload from your camera roll.
          After analysis, NatureDex provides the common and scientific names of the identified plant so you can easily learn more about the plants you find.
          NatureDex also keeps a record of all the plants you‚Äôve spotted before so you can look back at all of the trees and plants you‚Äôve ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù!
