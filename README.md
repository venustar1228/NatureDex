First Overall (based on originality, technology, design, completion, learning and theme)

## Inspiration
When going for a hike or a walk, you see lots of different plants. Ever seen a beautiful flower and wondered what it was called? Or a tree whose name you just can’t quite remember? NatureDex is here to help you identify and keep track of all the cool plants you encounter on your adventures!

## What it does
NatureDex utilizes the Plant.id api to identify plants by analyzing photos that you take or upload from your camera roll. After analysis, NatureDex provides the common and scientific names of the identified plant so you can easily learn more about the plants you find. NatureDex also keeps a record of all the plants you’ve spotted before so you can look back at all of the trees and plants you’ve “captured”!

## How we built it
We built this app using React Native on Expo for the front end. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, and utilizes MongoDB to store users’ plants. The server is hosted on Google App Engine. The website is hosted on Firebase. The Plant.id API is used to identify plants from user photos.

## Challenges we ran into
We had some trouble connecting the tables and the databases together. It was also a little difficult to figure out the different navigation stacks for our application screens.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of working with a third party API. This was the first time we had done so in a while and the documentation wasn’t very extensive so we had to figure out parts through examples and testing. We are very proud to have managed to create a fully functional finished application with a pleasing UI/UX within 48 hours while miles apart. 

## What we learned
We learned a lot more about working with React Native to create mobile applications and how to manage databases operations more efficiently.

## What's next for NatureDex
We want to expand NatureDex’s capabilities beyond plants to include animals such as birds and insects. We would also love to work on training our own models for recognizing different plants and animals!
